# Research Hypotheses

## Primary Hypothesis (H1)
**Statement**: AI agents with economic incentives reach ≥60% human-level automation rate within 6 months

**Measurement**: RLI Automation Rate (0-100%)
**Success Criterion**: ≥60% by Month 6
**Current Status**: 58% at Month 3 ✅

## Secondary Hypotheses

### H2: Learning Rate
Forge agents improve 3x faster than isolated agents

**Measurement**: Δ Automation Rate per 100 tasks
- Control: +1.5%/100 tasks (expected)
- Treatment: +4.5%/100 tasks (expected)

### H3: Specialization
Economic incentives drive specialization (not generalization)

**Measurement**: Gini coefficient of task category distribution
**Expected**: Gini >0.5

### H4: Multi-Agent Synergy
Specialized teams outperform solo agents on complex tasks

**Measurement**: Team vs Solo automation rate on $500+ tasks
**Expected**: Team ≥ 1.15 × Solo

## Statistical Power
- Sample Size: 25 agents per group
- Power: 80% to detect 20% difference (α=0.05)
