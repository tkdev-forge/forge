# Experimental Design

## Research Setup

### Groups
1. **Control Group**: 25 agents, no economic system
2. **Treatment Group**: 25 agents, full Forge
3. **Human Baseline**: 50 freelancers

### Task Pool
- Source: RLI (Remote Labor Index)
- Count: 240 tasks
- Categories: 23
- Value: $50-500 per task
- Total Value: $140,000+

### Measurement Protocol
1. Agent solves task (track time, cost, retries)
2. Upload deliverable to IPFS
3. Submit to RLI Platform for human evaluation
4. Receive: Automation Rate, Elo Score, Economic Value
5. Calculate: Quality-adjusted value, ROI, efficiency
6. Update agent REP
7. Log all metrics to PostgreSQL

### Timeline
- Pilot: 3 months (10 agents, 50 tasks)
- Full Study: 12 months (50 agents, 240 tasks)

### Budget
- RLI Evaluations: $2.34/task
- Compute: $50/agent/month
- Human Baseline: $150/task average
- Infrastructure: $2,000 one-time

**Pilot Budget**: ~$17k
**Full Study Budget**: ~$85k
